# RIHA-Browser [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/e-gov/RIHA-Browser.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/e-gov/RIHA-Browser)

Software application that allows a human user to browse descriptions and approval decisions.

## Prerequisites
- java8
- npm
- maven >= 3.3.1

## Modules

RIHA-Browser is a multi-module project and is divided to frontend and backend modules. 

### Frontend

Frontend is a Angular 4 module generated by [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.4.

Maven tasks can be run from within `frontend` directory. Eg.: `mvn frontend:yarn@goal_id`

You can run static web server to check application with command from within `frontend` directory:
```bash
mvn frontend:yarn@args -Dyarn.args="run static"
```

The same way you can run build steps separate independ on each other,
but only after finishing the `frontend:install-node-and-yarn`, `frontend:yarn` goals in `pom.xml` by the command:
```bash
# to install node, yarn and other node packages
mvn frontend:install-node-and-yarn frontend:yarn

# for building application into main/resources directory
mvn frontend:yarn@build 

# to check code style
mvn frontend:yarn@lint

# to run tests
mvn frontend:yarn@test
```

#### Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

#### Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|module`.

#### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build. In order to build whole application, please refer to [scripts section](#scripts).

#### Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io). In order to test whole application, please refer to [scripts section](#scripts).

#### Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.

#### Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).

### Backend
Backend is a Spring Boot maven module located in `backed` directory.

#### Test
Tests can be run from within `backend` directory by executing `test` maven goal, e.g.: `mvn test`. In order to test whole application, please refer to [scripts section](#scripts).

#### Build
Backend can be built by executing `package` maven goal, e.g.: `mvn package`. In order to build whole application, please refer to [scripts section](#scripts).

## Scripts

Project contains shell scripts in order to ease test and build process.

### test.sh
Run `test.sh` script from project root directory in order to build and test whole project.

It will install node, yarn, other node packages into `frontend` directory in order to build frontend module. Additionally it will run lint to check code style and phantomjs headless browser with karma to run tests.

### build.sh
Run `build.sh` script in order to build whole project producing executable spring boot jar. Tests will be skipped.
